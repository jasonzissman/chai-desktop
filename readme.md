# launch-programs
This is an attempt to use speech recognition to launch programs on my desktop. The end-game is to be able to say "Launch Bojack Horseman on Netflix" and have chrome open to Netflix with Bojack Horseman playing.

## Running the app
Simply enter `dotnet run`

## Simple way to launch applications with Cortana

1. Create a batch file that can perform a task, such as launching chrome at specific URL.
2. Create shortcut to that batch file and place here: C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs
3. Cortana can now invoke that shortcut
